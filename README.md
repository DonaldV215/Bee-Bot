# Bee-Bot
Within the source code is arduino code that runs a line follower robot.
Note, though the code is in txt it's meant for arduino: simply copy paste code into arduino IDE and voila.
Must have the exact same wiring schema as presented in the code or change ports in code or robot won't function.
